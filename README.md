Chess created in Java

Created in about 3 weeks using very basic repetitive logic. I'm sure it has some bugs I've missed.

Some features it does have:
* Prevents illegal moves 
* Checks for checkmate
* Pawn promotion
* Documents and saves each move made

Some features it current lacks
* Castling
* En passant
